THREAD/CONVERSATION ISSUE - DETAILED EXPLANATION
==============================================

PROBLEM:
--------
When you try to create new conversations/threads by:
1. Selecting code
2. Clicking "Ask AI"
3. Typing a question
4. Submitting

The new threads are NOT appearing in the thread panel on the right side.


WHAT WE NEED TO DIAGNOSE:
--------------------------
We added extensive logging to track what's happening, but we haven't seen ANY of these logs yet:

🔘 Ask AI button clicked!
🔍 Current selection: [selection data]
=== SUBMIT QUESTION STARTED ===
🎯 NEW THREAD CREATED: [thread id]
📊 TOTAL THREADS NOW: [number]

This means one of these things is happening:

1. The "Ask AI" button is not clickable/visible
2. The button click is not triggering the handler
3. The question dialog is not opening
4. The submit is failing silently


WHAT YOU NEED TO DO RIGHT NOW:
------------------------------

Step 1: REFRESH THE PAGE
   - Press Cmd+R or F5 to reload
   - This ensures all our new logging code is loaded

Step 2: OPEN BROWSER CONSOLE
   - Press F12 or Cmd+Option+I
   - Click the "Console" tab
   - Keep it open and visible

Step 3: SELECT CODE
   - Click and drag in the editor to select some code (any lines)
   - You should see logs like:
     🎨 AIButton rendering - hasSelection: true, canInteract: true

   If you see "hasSelection: false" then the selection isn't being captured

Step 4: LOOK AT THE "ASK AI" BUTTON
   - Is it visible in the top header?
   - Is it blue (enabled) or gray (disabled)?
   - Take a screenshot if possible

Step 5: CLICK "ASK AI" BUTTON
   - Click it
   - Watch the console for:
     🔘 Ask AI button clicked!

   If you DON'T see this log, the click handler is not attached

Step 6: IF DIALOG OPENS
   - Type any question (e.g., "what does this do?")
   - Click "Ask AI" or press Cmd+Enter
   - Watch console for:
     === SUBMIT QUESTION STARTED ===
     🎯 NEW THREAD CREATED: [id]

Step 7: COPY ALL CONSOLE OUTPUT
   - Right-click in console
   - Select "Save as..." or just copy everything
   - Paste it into a response


POSSIBLE CAUSES (RANKED BY LIKELIHOOD):
----------------------------------------

1. MOST LIKELY: The selection is clearing when you click away
   - When you click "Ask AI", the editor loses focus
   - The selection might be getting cleared
   - Fix: We need to capture selection when dialog opens

2. LIKELY: currentSelection is null/undefined in AIButton
   - The store might not be sharing state properly
   - The component might be using stale state
   - Fix: Check if AIButton has access to the selection

3. POSSIBLE: Click event is being blocked
   - CSS z-index issue
   - Another element is on top of the button
   - Button is disabled when it shouldn't be

4. POSSIBLE: Dialog is opening but invisible
   - CSS issue hiding the modal
   - Wrong z-index
   - Modal is rendering off-screen

5. UNLIKELY: JavaScript error preventing execution
   - Would show in console as red error
   - Would prevent entire app from working


WHAT I NEED FROM YOU:
---------------------

1. Tell me if you can SEE the "Ask AI" button
2. Tell me if it's BLUE (enabled) or GRAY (disabled) when you select code
3. Tell me if clicking it does ANYTHING (dialog opens, error appears, etc.)
4. Send me the COMPLETE console output after:
   - Refreshing page
   - Selecting code
   - Clicking "Ask AI"
   - Trying to submit a question


TEMPORARY WORKAROUND:
--------------------
None available until we diagnose the root cause.


CRITICAL QUESTION:
-----------------
Have you EVER successfully created a conversation/thread in this app?
Or has it never worked from the beginning?

The localStorage showed 1 thread existed, so either:
- It worked once before and broke
- You manually edited localStorage
- There's old test data
