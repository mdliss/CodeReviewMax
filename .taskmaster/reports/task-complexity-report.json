		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup React Project with Vite",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed for this task.",
			"reasoning": "Setting up a React project with Vite is straightforward due to well-documented tools and minimal configuration requirements. The task involves running a command and ensuring dependencies are installed, which is standard for modern JavaScript projects."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Monaco Editor",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Consider breaking down the task into subtasks such as 'Install and Configure Monaco Editor' and 'Implement Event Handling for Editor'.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating Monaco Editor involves handling complex configurations and ensuring compatibility with React. The task requires understanding of both the editor's API and React's component lifecycle, making it moderately complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Code Selection and Highlighting",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into 'Implement Selection Tracking' and 'Develop Highlighting Logic'.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires deep integration with the Monaco Editor API to track and highlight code selections. It involves managing application state and ensuring accurate UI updates, which adds complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Develop AI Interaction Mechanism",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Consider subtasks like 'Design API Request Structure', 'Implement AI Button UI', and 'Handle API Responses'.",
			"reasoning": "Interacting with an AI API involves designing a robust request/response mechanism, handling asynchronous operations, and ensuring UI responsiveness. The task is complex due to the need for precise data handling and user interaction design."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Design Thread Management System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subtasks could include 'Design Data Structure for Threads', 'Implement State Management with Zustand', and 'Develop UI for Thread Indicators'.",
			"reasoning": "Managing conversation threads requires a well-designed state management system and UI components to display threads accurately. The task involves both backend logic and frontend UI design, increasing its complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Application State Persistence",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Consider subtasks like 'Implement State Serialization' and 'Develop State Restoration Logic'.",
			"reasoning": "Persisting application state involves handling serialization and deserialization of data, which is moderately complex. It requires careful management of state changes and ensuring data integrity across sessions."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Develop User Interface with Tailwind CSS",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 1,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subtask could be 'Integrate Tailwind CSS and Design Layout'.",
			"reasoning": "Styling with Tailwind CSS is relatively straightforward due to its utility-first approach. The task involves integrating the library and designing responsive layouts, which is manageable with existing tools and documentation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Optimize AI Response Handling",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into 'Implement Loading States' and 'Optimize Response Processing'.",
			"reasoning": "Optimizing response handling involves managing asynchronous operations and ensuring smooth user experience. The task requires careful design of UI states and efficient data processing, adding to its complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Read-Only Mode Toggle",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 1,
			"expansionPrompt": "Consider a subtask like 'Develop Toggle Logic and UI'.",
			"reasoning": "Toggling between modes in Monaco Editor is relatively simple due to its API support. The task involves implementing a toggle mechanism and ensuring it integrates well with existing UI components."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Conduct Usability Testing",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subtasks could include 'Plan Testing Sessions' and 'Analyze User Feedback'.",
			"reasoning": "Usability testing involves organizing sessions, collecting feedback, and analyzing results. While not technically complex, it requires careful planning and execution to gather meaningful insights."
